### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/vbnet/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.vb` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/vbnet/bob/bob.vb`.
